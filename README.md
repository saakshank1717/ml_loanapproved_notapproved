# ml_loanapproved_notapproved
This project developed a machine learning pipeline to automate loan eligibility using a Decision Tree and Bagging Ensemble. While a single tree reached 78.4% accuracy, it was prone to overfitting due to the small dataset size (~600 rows). By implementing a Bagging Classifier with 300 estimators, we stabilized the model and improved its risk-detection capabilities. The final ensemble achieved a remarkable 95% precision for rejections, ensuring that "bad" loan flags are highly accurate. Although overall accuracy slightly decreased to 77%, the model became more robust and better at identifying risky applicants (True Negatives). This trade-off reflects a conservative banking strategy that prioritizes financial safety and customer trust over raw volume
